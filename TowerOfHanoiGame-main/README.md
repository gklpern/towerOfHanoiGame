# Tower of Hanoi 

## Purpose
The aim of this project is to examine the Tower of Hanoi problem through problem solving and algorithmic thinking. It is aimed to compare this algorithm using various algorithms in terms of performance and efficiency. Moreover, creating a user interface to visualize the progress of the game will increase understanding and engagement in the problem-solving process. Working in groups will foster collaborative learning and allow students to combine programming, algorithm design, and interface development skills to tackle a challenging and timeless problem.

## Introduction
The Tower of Hanoi is a classic puzzle or game that originated in the 19th century. It's a mathematical problem that has also been used as a game to challenge people's problem-solving skills. The game consists of a set of disks of different sizes and three rods or pegs. The objective is to move the entire stack of disks from one rod to another, following specific rules.

Here are the basic rules and an introduction to the Tower of Hanoi game:

Objective:
The goal of the Tower of Hanoi is to move all the disks from the starting rod to the target rod, following the rules, and using the intermediate rod as needed.

Setup:

The game begins with a set of disks of different sizes stacked in decreasing order of size on one rod. The smallest disk is at the top, and the largest disk is at the bottom.
There are three rods labeled A, B, and C.

Rules:

Only one disk can be moved at a time.
Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk or an empty rod.

## GUI
When the application is first run, the application receives the disk number from the user as input, as shown in below.

Then the user will enter how many disks wants, after that the GUI will open, as presented below.

Then, the designed GUI appears on the screen and 3 Buttons are presented to the user, as shown in the below image, which allows us to start and close the application and choose which algorithm it is solved with, either iterative or recursive algorithm.

After the GUI opens, the user selects the algorithm and presses the start button, and the problem begins to be solved step by step. Each move and the execution time of the algorithm are displayed to the user at the top of the frame.
